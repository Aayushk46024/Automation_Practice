I have use the page object model and page factory classes for the project.
I have divided into 4 packages Config, Pages, TestBase and Tests.
The Config package, I have used for properties file.
The Pages package used to write the all the test script(SignIn, LogIn, HomePage,  SignOut, PageDemo)
The TestBase package used to write for launch the browser and close the browser. 
The Tests package used to call the methods of the pages package accordingly.
